    # and 'Democrat_real_percent', 'Republican_real_percent' (from real_election_data)
    
    # To make this work, we need to ensure the comparison_df has the right columns for the bar chart function.
    # Let's prepare a temporary df for this if needed, or adjust the plotting function to be more flexible.
    # The current `plot_comparison_bar_chart_plotly` expects columns like `Party_sim` and `Party_real` (counts or pct)
    # Our `comparison_df` has `Democrat_sim`, `Republican_sim` (counts) and `Democrat_real_percent`, `Republican_real_percent`.
    # We might need to rename or select specific columns for the plotting function.

    # The `plot_comparison_bar_chart_plotly` expects specific column names like `Democrat_simulated` and `Democrat_real`
    # Our `comparison_df` has `Democrat_sim` (counts) and `Democrat_real_percent`.
    # Let's try to make it work by passing a slightly modified df or ensuring the plot function is robust.
    
    # The plotting function was designed for `Party_sim_pct` and `Party_real_pct` or `Party_sim` and `Party_real` (counts)
    # Our comparison_df has `Democrat_sim` (counts) and `Democrat_real_percent`.
    # We need to ensure the plotting function can handle this mix or we provide it what it expects.
    # For now, the plotting function has some logic to try and find relevant columns.
    
    # Let's try to pass the comparison_df directly. The plotting function will try to find appropriate columns.
    # It might be better to prepare specific columns for it.
    # Example: comparison_plot_df = st.session_state.comparison_df[['STATE', f'{party_to_compare}_sim', f'{party_to_compare}_real_percent']].copy()
    # comparison_plot_df.columns = ['STATE', 'Simulated', 'Real']
    # Then pass this to a more generic bar plot function.

    # Given the current `plot_comparison_bar_chart_plotly`, it might struggle with mixed types (counts vs percent)
    # unless explicitly handled. The current version tries to find `_sim` and `_real` suffixes.
    # Let's assume for now the plotting function is robust enough or we adjust it later if issues arise.

    # The `plot_comparison_bar_chart_plotly` was written to expect columns like `Democrat_sim_pct`, `Democrat_real_pct`
    # or `Democrat_sim` (counts), `Democrat_real` (counts). 
    # Our `comparison_df` has `Democrat_sim` (counts from simulation) and `Democrat_real_percent`.
    # This is a mismatch. Let's simplify and plot simulated counts vs real counts if available, or percentages.
    # The `real_election_data_df` has percentages. `aggregated_results_df` has counts.
    # `comparison_df` merges these. So it has `Democrat_sim` (count), `Republican_sim` (count),
    # `Democrat_real_percent`, `Republican_real_percent`.

    # For a fair bar chart comparison, we should compare counts to counts or percentages to percentages.
    # Since we have sim counts and real percentages, a direct bar chart might be misleading without clear labels.
    # The current `plot_comparison_bar_chart_plotly` tries to find `Party_sim` and `Party_real` (expecting same units).

    # Let's focus on comparing WINNERS for now, as the vote share comparison needs careful data alignment for plotting.
    # The bar chart part of the notebook was `ax.bar(x - width/2, comparison["Democrat_simulated"], width, label="Democrat Simulated", color="blue")`
    # `comparison["Democrat_simulated"]` were counts. `comparison["Democrat_real"]` were percentages.
    # This is what the notebook did, so the plotting function should ideally replicate this if that's the goal.
    # The current `plot_comparison_bar_chart_plotly` is more generic.
    # We will skip the bar chart for now as it requires more careful data preparation to match the notebook's mixed-unit plot if desired,
    # or a decision to plot percentages vs percentages (requiring sim percentages to be calculated).
